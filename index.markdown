I made this site as a way to crowdsource all the links to make an impact on one page. Right now, there's a lot of posts on social media that I keep seeing, but I wanted to aggregate all of them into one source so anyone can add links and people can use this as a one-stop shop to get to all the appropriate ways to take action. 

Special thanks to [VMagazine](https://vmagazine.com/article/how-to-get-involved-in-demanding-justice-for-george-floyd/), which already did something like this and whose descriptions I used for a lot of the links here. I just wanted to make it open sourced, so anybody can contribute as well. Another shoutout to [blacklivesmatters.carrd.co](blacklivesmatters.carrd.co) for a lot more sources used here. Also shoutout to [Maasai Goodwin (@maasaipg on Instagram)](http://instagram.com/maasaipg) for the email template shared on Instagram.
